## From design to deploy


I build fast, accessible interfaces with TypeScript and React. From component libraries to data-heavy dashboards, I bring a design eye to every detail.


I ship with confidence through clean architecture, solid tests, and automation. Pragmatic tooling and clear boundaries keep things maintainable as products grow.
